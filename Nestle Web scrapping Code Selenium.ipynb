The gold really boosts the instant coffee drinking experience.\\n\\nFor making black coffee you just need to a 2 teaspoon to a cup of about 125-150ml. Again this depends on personal preferences and a bit of sugar for taste. The coffee releases a white crema when the water is hot if it does not that means your water is not hot enough for the coffee to dissolve completely.\\nThe black coffee is really yummy and smooth with a slight tanginess of the coffee bean.'},\n",
