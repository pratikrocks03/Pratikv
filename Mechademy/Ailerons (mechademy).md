#  Ailerons data set (using ailerons)


This project and  data set addresses a control problem, namely flying a F16 aircraft. The attributes describe the 
status of the airplane, while the goal is to predict the control action on the ailerons of the aircraft

## Documentation

So after EDA, Preprocessing, Outlier Removal, Model training and building and last after prediction we are getting very less error and we can say that our model is performing extremly well and we can deploy it for future.
